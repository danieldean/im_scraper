## im_scraper

A simple script to scrape results for Ironman races. For this to work you will need to find the Event ID and WTC Private Key both of which will be in the requests to the server when viewing the results page (use Developer tools).

This is intended as a proof of concept not an actual means to mass retrieve race results.
